# Start fresh (don’t inherit .gitignore)
# You can still ignore what you like—but we must include our manifests.

# Ignore build outputs and deps
node_modules/
server/dist/
client/node_modules/
client/dist/
data
*.md

# But explicitly include the things we need:
!Dockerfile
!package.json
!package-lock.json
!server/package.json
!server/tsconfig.json
!server/src/**
